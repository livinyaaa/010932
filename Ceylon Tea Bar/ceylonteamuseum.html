            <p>Situated around four kilometres to the south of Kandy, the Ceylon Tea Museum occupies a building that was once the Hatane Tea Factory, constructed in 1925. The tea factory had been abandoned for over a decade before the Chairman of the Sri Lanka Tea Board, Clifford Ratwatte, incorporated the Ceylon Tea Museum into it in 1998. The Tea Board and the Planters’ Association of Sri Lanka ensured that the building was refurbished for its new designation as a museum, and it was formally opened to the public on the 1st of December in 2001.</p>

                <p>Brilliant!
                    If you want to learn a bit about the history of tea in Sri Lanka this is a great place to visit. Lots of wonderful old machinery and all sorts of interesting displays. Fascinating and well worth a visit!</p>

                <p>Interesting and worth seeing
                    After a lot of Temples and relics it was interesting to see the history of tea and the way it is dried and sorted and graded - worth visiting and fun to have tea in their shop and of course buy tea!</p>

                <p>Not to be missed!
                    This quiet museum is a hidden gem!! Absolutely underrated by guide books! It was fascinating to see traditional tea making equipment, and learn the history. Our entrance fee included a complementary guide who was professional and spoke excellent English. We finished with a delicious cup of tea in the café overlooking great views, and buying different types of tea from the shop for our friends and family.</p>
